# familyConf
A family videoconference setup

## Intro
In the Covid-19 time, there have been (and may be) times when we can't be together with our families. Videoconferencing platforms have been highly used for this purpose, but as with any other technologies, it might be frequent that elder people struggle with it and can't participate leaving them isolated.

The purpose of this project is to set up a simple, low cost and easy to use videoconferencing system for my grandparents and any grandparents in the world, or whoever prefers to use their TV instead of a computer or a smartphone to speak with their loved ones.

It requires some preparation beforehand, but the idea is that once installed it is as easy to use as possible.

## Materials

- A raspberry pi - any of them. I chose raspi 3 even if 4 was already out since it is much cheaper and has ports compatible with older devices.
- A SD card and card reader for the set up of the raspi OS.
- A webcam
- A remote control

## Setup

## Questions

*Hangouts:*
- How long do unique conference links last?
- How can I share a link with somebody?
